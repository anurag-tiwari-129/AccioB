    EXPLANATION :
        Circular and Square sandwiches referred by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
            1. If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
            2. Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
            3. This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
