    INPUT :
        bbb
    OUTPUT :
        3
    EXPLANATION :
        Here "bbb" or "bb" or "b" as the substring, but taking "b" yields us maximum frequency which is 3.
        So print the frequency of that substring who is 
            1. present at both start & end point 
            2. as well as its occurrence is maximum. 
        If such substring doesn't exist, print 1.
