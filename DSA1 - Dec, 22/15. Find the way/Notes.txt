    EXPLANATION :
        A mouse enters the matrix at cell (0,0) in left to right direction.
            1. He goes in the same direction if he encounters a 0 and 
            2. he takes a right turn when he encounters a 1, and changes that specific 1 to 0. 
            3. Otherwise he may get stuck in a cycle!
